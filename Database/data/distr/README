The three shapefiles in this directory are used by CREATE_DISTR_M01.BAT to develop DISTR and M01 files.

 * A shapefile of the current subzone centroids (including a Zone field).
 * A shapefile of the current zone system (including a SQMI field).
 * A shapefile of random points within each zone.

		- Number of Points: 30
		- Minimum Allowed Distance: 500 feet
