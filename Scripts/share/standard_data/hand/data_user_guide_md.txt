# CMAP Travel Demand Model Data User Guide ({{ model_version }})

This dataset includes the analysis year inputs and outputs from the Air Quality
Conformity Analysis approved in {{ approval_date }}. The horizon year is 2050
and reflects the policies and projects adopted in the ON TO 2050 Regional
Comprehensive Plan.

The air quality analysis is completed twice annually, in the second quarter and
the fourth quarter.  The data associated with the analysis is named based on
the year the analysis was completed and the quarter it was completed.
Therefore, the files in this dataset are referred to as {{ model_version }}
data.

The analysis years for this conformity cycle include 2019, 2025, 2030, 2035,
2040, and 2050.  We associate scenario numbers with the analysis years as shown
below.  You will notice the scenario numbers 100–700 referenced in many of the
filenames or in headers within the files.

| Analysis year | Scenario number |
| --- | ---|
| 2019 | 100 |
| 2025 | 200 |
| 2030 | 300 |
| 2035 | 400 |
| 2040 | 500 |
| 2050 | 700 |

## Resources

**Trip Generation Data** ({{ tg_data }})  
This is a CSV table containing the trip generation inputs and outputs by trip
generation zone, the most disaggregate modeling geography. The trip generation
zone ID is subzone17. The information can be linked to the trip generation zone
shapefile, described later, via the variable subzone17. This file includes a
number of variables related to low-income and high-income households. The
definition of a low-income household for our purposes is a household that earns
less than the regional median household income. A high-income household earns
more than the regional median household income.

The variables are defined this way:

| Field name | Value definition |

| subzone17 | Trip generation zone |
| fips | Census county code |
| cnty_name | County name |
| state | Illinois, Wisconsin, or Indiana, because the modeled region covers multiple states |

**Production-Attraction Tables** ({{ pa_tables }})  
This compressed folder contains person trip productions and attractions which
were read and used by the destination choice-mode choice model. The source of
this data is the trip generation outputs described previously. These are
structured text files in fixed-width format. The information can be linked to
the traffic analysis zone shapefile zone17, described later, via the zone
number.

| Columns | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1–6 | Trip generation subzone |
| 7–12 | Modeling zone |
| 13–14 | Trip purpose code |
| 15–23 | Household and non-institutionalized group quarters trip productions |
| 24–32 | Household and non-institutionalized group quarters trip attractions |

<br>

**Distributed Trip Tables** ({{ trip_tables }})  
This compressed folder includes CSV matrices. The low-income and
high-income trip tables represent travel made by workers living in households
that earn below and above the regional median household income. The individual
trip tables sum to the totals for home-based work auto and home-based work
transit trips.

The CMAP network assignment process requires the truck vehicle trips (actual
matrix contents) to be converted to vehicle equivalents. The factors used are
b-plate and light trucks=1 vehicle equivalent, medium trucks=2 vehicle
equivalents, and heavy trucks=3 vehicle equivalents.

Because of the unique way the transit network is coded, the transit trip tables
cannot be assigned directly to the transit network.

**HOV Trip Tables** ({{ hov_trip_tables }})  
This compressed folder contains individual SOV and HOV trip detail tables by
purpose. hbw_sov.csv, hbw_hov2.csv, and hbw_hov3.csv contain home based work
trips for SOV, HOV2 and HOV3+, respectively. hbo_sov.csv, hbo_hov2.csv, and
hbo_hov3.csv hold home based other trips, hbs_sov.csv, hbs_hov2.csv, and
hbs_hov3.csv hold home based shopping trips and nhb_sov.csv, nhb_hov2.csv, and
nhb_hov3.csv hold non-home based trips.

<br>

**Emme Highway Networks** ({{ highway_networks }})  
This compressed folder includes files named network_p1–network_p8. These are
assigned highway networks Emme exported from the database for period 1 through
period 8, denoted by the file labels p1–p8. Each Emme transaction format text
file, consists of two parts. The first part is the node section, the second
part is the link section. The period link capacity is calculated during the
modeling process using @emcap\*lanes\*hours in the period for each link.

Also included is a “daily” network that has all links (including both
directions of reversible lanes) and an associated attribute table that has the
daily assigned volume in vehicles.

The files titled attribs_p1–attribs_p8 are TXT format Emme extra attribute
files for period 1 through period 8, denoted by the file labels p1–p8. The file
format and contents of the networks and network extra attributes are presented
below.

| Period | Hours |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 8pm–6am |
| 2 | 6–7am |
| 3 | 7–9am |
| 4 | 9–10am |
| 5 | 10am–2pm |
| 6 | 2–4pm |
| 7 | 4–6pm |
| 8 | 6–8pm |

Many people are interested in using the congested link travel times. The
congested link travel times in minutes are included as “timau” in the extra
attribute file. Use caution, however, as these times are raw model results.
CMAP adjusts the arterial speeds before using them in the air quality analysis
software. Also, you will notice that links with an i-node or j-node less than
5000 have the same congested times in all periods. These are centroid
connectors and the travel time is based on distance, not on congestion.

Network and extra attribute file layout:  
A network file contains two sections, nodes and links, whose starts are marked
by “t nodes init” and “t links init”.

t nodes init

Toll rates are:

- @toll – Auto toll (dollars)
- @toll2 – Light truck toll (dollars)
- @toll3 – Medium truck toll (dollars)
- @toll4 – Heavy truck toll (dollars)

These are daytime tolls for trucks.

**Emme Databank** ({{ database }})  
This is the final databank for the analysis year and was created with Emme
version 23.00.01.23. Most of the files described in this document are exported

files or use the Emme databank directly.

<br>

**Emme Databank Matrix Directory** ({{ matrices }})  
The current version of Emme stores matrices externally from the Emme databank.
This file contains the entire directory of matrices referenced by the Emme
databank described previously. If the user is interested in using the Emme
databank with its matrices, this ffolder should be downloaded and uncompressed
in the same directory as the databank.
