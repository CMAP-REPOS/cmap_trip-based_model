Dear Data User:

This dataset includes the analysis year {{ year }} inputs and outputs
from the Air Quality Conformity Analysis approved in {{ approval_date }}.  The
horizon year is 2050 and reflects the policies and projects adopted in the ON
TO 2050 Regional Comprehensive Plan.

The air quality analysis is completed twice annually, in the second quarter and
the fourth quarter.  The data associated with the analysis is named based on
the year the analysis was completed and the quarter it was completed.
Therefore, the files in this dataset are referred to as {{ conformity_code }}
data.

The analysis years for this conformity cycle include 2019, 2025, 2030, 2035,
2040, and 2050.  We associate scenario numbers with the analysis years as shown
below.  You will notice the scenario numbers 100â€“700 referenced in many of the
filenames or in headers within the files.

| Analysis year	| Scenario number |
| --- | ---|
| 2019 | 100 |
| 2025 | 200 |
| 2030 | 300 |
| 2035 | 400 |
| 2040 | 600 |
| 2050 | 700 |

**Trip Generation Data** ({{ tg_data }})  
This is a CSV table containing the trip generation inputs and outputs by trip
generation zone, the most disaggregate modeling geography.  The trip generation
zone ID is subzone17.  The information can be linked to the trip generation
zone shapefile, described later, via the variable subzone17.  This file
includes a number of variables related to low and high-income workers.  The
definition of a low-income worker for our purposes is a worker who earns less
than the regional median income.  A high-income worker earns more than the
regional median income.  The variables are defined this way:
