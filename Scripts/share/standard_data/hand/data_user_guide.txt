Dear Data User:

This dataset includes the analysis year inputs and outputs from the Air Quality
Conformity Analysis approved in {{ approval_date }}. The horizon year is 2050
and reflects the policies and projects adopted in the ON TO 2050 Regional
Comprehensive Plan.

The air quality analysis is completed twice annually, in the second quarter and
the fourth quarter.  The data associated with the analysis is named based on
the year the analysis was completed and the quarter it was completed.
Therefore, the files in this dataset are referred to as {{ model_version }}
data.

The analysis years for this conformity cycle include 2019, 2025, 2030, 2035,
2040, and 2050.  We associate scenario numbers with the analysis years as shown
below.  You will notice the scenario numbers 100–700 referenced in many of the
filenames or in headers within the files.

| Analysis year | Scenario number |
| --- | ---|
| 2019 | 100 |
| 2025 | 200 |
| 2030 | 300 |
| 2035 | 400 |
| 2040 | 600 |
| 2050 | 700 |

**Trip Generation Data** ({{ tg_data }})  
This is a CSV table containing the trip generation inputs and outputs by trip
generation zone, the most disaggregate modeling geography.  The trip generation
zone ID is subzone17.  The information can be linked to the trip generation
zone shapefile, described later, via the variable subzone17.  This file
includes a number of variables related to low and high-income workers.  The
definition of a low-income worker for our purposes is a worker who earns less
than the regional median income.  A high-income worker earns more than the
regional median income.  The variables are defined this way:

| Field name | Value definition |

**Trip Generation Matrices** ({{ tg_matrices }})  
This compressed folder contains eight matrices of person trip productions and
attractions which were imported and used as origin and destination totals for
the trip distribution model. The source of this data is the trip generation
outputs described previously, aggregated up to the traffic analysiszone system,
zone17. These are structured text files in Emme transaction format. The
information can be linked to the traffic analysis zone shapefile zone17,
described later, via the zone number.

| Filename | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| hwphi.in | Home-based work productions, high-income |
| hwplo.in | Home-based work productions, low-income |
| hop.in | Home-based other productions |
| nhp.in | Non-home-based productions |
| hwahi.in | Home-based work attractions, high-income |
| hwalo.in | Home-based work attractions, low-income |
| hoa.in | Home-based other attractions |
| nha.in | Non-home-based attractions |

The production files have 3 lines of headers followed by “origin zone”  “all:”
“trips” in each of the remaining records.

The attraction files have 3 lines of headers followed by “all”  “destination
zone:”  “trips” in each of the remaining records.

**Distributed Trip Tables** ({{ trip_tables }})  
This compressed folder includes 16 CSV matrices.

The CMAP network assignment process requires the truck vehicle trips (actual
matrix contents) to be converted to vehicle equivalents. The factors used are
b-plate and light trucks=1 vehicle equivalent, medium trucks=2 vehicle
equivalents, and heavy trucks=3 vehicle equivalents.

Because of the unique way the transit network is coded, the transit trip tables
cannot be assigned directly to the transit network.

| Filename | Format | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hbw_auto.csv | P/A | Home-based work auto person trips |
| hbo_auto.csv | P/A | Home-based other auto person trips |
| hbs_auto.csv | P/A | Home-based shopping auto person trips |
| nhb_auto.csv | O/D | Non-home-based auto person trips |
| mf4.csv | O/D | B-plate truck vehicle trips |
| mf5.csv | O/D | Light truck vehicle trips |
| mf6.csv | O/D | Medium truck vehicle trips |

| dead_auto.csv | O/D | Deadhead auto person trips (TNCs) |

<br>

**Distributed Work Trip Tables** ({{ work_trip_tables }})  
This compressed folder contains the work trip detail tables. The low and
high-income trip tables represent travel made by workers who earn below and
above the regional median income. The individual trip tables sum to the totals
for home-based work auto and home-based work transit trips shown in the
previous section.

| Filename | Format | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hbwL_all.csv | P/A | Home-based work total person trips, low income |
| hbwH_all.csv | P/A | Home-based work total person trips, high income |
| mf40.csv | P/A | Home-based work transit person trips, low income |
| mf41.csv | P/A | Home-based work transit person trips, high income |
| hbwL_auto.csv | P/A | Home-based work auto person trips, low income |
| hbwH_auto.csv | P/A | Home-based work auto person trips, high income |

<br>

**HOV Trip Tables** ({{ hov_trip_tables }})  
This compressed folder contains individual SOV and HOV trip detail tables by
purpose. hbw_sov.csv, hbw_hov2.csv, and hbw_hov3.csv contain home based work
trips for SOV, HOV2 and HOV3+, respectively. hbo_sov.csv, hbo_hov2.csv, and
hbo_hov3.csv hold home based other trips, hbs_sov.csv, hbs_hov2.csv, and
hbs_hov3.csv hold home based shopping trips and nhb_sov.csv, nhb_hov2.csv, and
nhb_hov3.csv hold non-home based trips.

<br>

**Emme Highway Networks** ({{ highway_networks }})  
This compressed folder includes files named network_p1–network_p8. These are
assigned highway networks Emme exported from the database for period 1 through
period 8, denoted by the file labels p1–p8. Each Emme transaction format text
file, consists of two parts. The first part is the node section, the second
part is the link section. The period link capacity is calculated during the
modeling process using @emcap*lanes*hours in the period for each link.

Also included is a “daily” network that has all links (including both
directions of reversible lanes) and an associated attribute table that has the
daily assigned volume in vehicles.

The files titled attribs_p1–attribs_p8 are TXT format Emme extra attribute
files for period 1 through period 8, denoted by the file labels p1–p8. The file
format and contents of the networks and network extra attributes are presented
below.

| Period | Hours |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 8pm–6am |
| 2 | 6–7am |
| 3 | 7–9am |
| 4 | 9–10am |
| 5 | 10am–2pm |
| 6 | 2–4pm |
| 7 | 4–6pm |
| 8 | 6–8pm |

Many people are interested in using the congested link travel times. The
congested link travel times in minutes are included as “timau” in the extra
attribute file. Use caution, however, as these times are raw model results.
CMAP adjusts the arterial speeds before using them in the air quality analysis
software. Also, you will notice that links with an i-node or j-node less than
5000 have the same congested times in all periods. These are centroid
connectors and the travel time is based on distance, not on congestion.

Network and extra attribute file layout:  
A network file contains two sections, nodes and links, whose starts are marked
by “t nodes init” and “t links init”.

t nodes init

- @avlqv – Light trucks
- @avmqv – Medium trucks vehicle equivalents
- @avhqv – Heavy trucks vehicle equivalents

@vadt contains the sum of vehicle class vehicle equivalents, converted to
vehicles – (@avauv + @avh2v + @avh3v + @avbqv + @avlqv + (@avmqv/2) +
(@avhqv/3)).

Toll rates are:

- @toll – Auto toll (dollars)
- @toll2 – Light truck toll (dollars)
- @toll3 – Medium truck toll (dollars)
- @toll4 – Heavy truck toll (dollars)

These are daytime tolls for trucks.
